# Small Nav Bar Application 

A small application build with HTML / CSS and Vanilla Javascript for testing. I didn't know which
pattern to follow so I've decided to use a OOP pattern using ES6+. Thinking mainly on reusability of the classes and DRY code.

I've also created a node server as I am fetchting information from a Json file and in that way I can
make sure I don't have any cors errors.



## Installation

Install node packages and run dev scripts. It is going to run on http://localhost:3000/

```bash
  npm install 
  npm run dev
```

In order to make changes on the project you can run webpack to generate bundle.js file.

```bash
  npm run build
```

You can have both running at the same time. As it is just a test I didn't want to complicated it more.
